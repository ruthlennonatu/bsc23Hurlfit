Week 2:
Currently working on implementing CI CD into the pipeline. I will be looking
into using Github Actions to check for various rules using the workflows.

Week 3:
Currently now working on implementing naming conventions for the branches that
can be created. It will check for pull requests and creation requests.

Week 5:
Updating the if statement to now check if the pull request being comapared is
going into the development branch.

Then I will check if the branch being requested in to main
is titled with the staging branch name. This will
mean that the correct workflow is being followed.

I am now checking to make sure that the origin pull
request branch is coming from the development branch
into the staging branch.

Week 8:
Looking into implementing automated documentaiton. Currently doing research into the best way
to do this. Goal is to achieve something using GitHub Pages.
