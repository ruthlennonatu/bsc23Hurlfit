Currently working on implementing CI CD into the pipeline. I will be looking
into using Github Actions to check for various rules using the workflows.

Currently now working on implementing naming conventions for the branches that
can be created. It will check for pull requests and creation requests.

Updating the if statement to now check if the pull request being comapared is
going into the development branch.

Then I will check if the branch being requested in to main
is titled with the staging branch name. This will
mean that the correct workflow is being followed.
