We can use MERN framework to develope a web application.
MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. It is used by developers worldwide.
The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. 
Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily. 

M - MongoDB :- which is a NoSQL database management system.data is stored in the form of documents having key-value pairs similar to JSON objects
E - ExpressJS :- It is a backend web application framework for NodeJS.
R - ReactJS :- a JavaScript library for developing UIs based on UI components.The JS library uses virtual DOM for doing everything.
N - NodeJS :- It is a JS runtime environment, i.e., it enables running JavaScript code outside the browser. 
              It comes with the node package manager or npm, enabling users to select from a wide selection of node modules or packages.
